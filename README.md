# virus_infection_in_supermarket
Simple simulation of people movement and virus infection inside a supermarket

From Jan. 2020, China has been under the threat of the coronavirus-2019. All sections of the city except the supermarket are closed temporarily. 
Inside a supermmarket, the connections between the customers and connections between customers and supermarket staffs are intimate, which makes people more vulnerable to virus infection. 
In this folder finds a file in Matlab named : Supermarket_people_flow_inf.m where a simple simulation of people movement and virus infection inside a supermarket. The infection is modeled just with distance and probability, which is a very raw modeling. Each person is treated as a moving point of mass in the code and his/her position is updated with simple time integration.

A simple video of the simulation is available in bilibili.com: https://www.bilibili.com/video/av86999704 if you are intersted in.
